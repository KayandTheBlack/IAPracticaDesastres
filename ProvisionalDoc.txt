Solution: Assignation of Flights to Helicopters, where a flight is a set of groups.
	travels[i][j][k]  = G_id 	
	means: Helicopter I, in its J-essim flight, rescues G_id as the kth group in that same flight
	%%Might need to add a groupAss[G_id] = (Hi,Ji,Ki) reverse vector. REVISIT
	%%When implementing, might need to change travels[i] to a vector of lists for efficiency (exchanging flights easily). Most likely not.
        %% Will need auxiliar structure HeliOrder [NFlights] = H_id, meaning: the Nth flight is performed by helicopter H_id

Eo: Our first solution will one of the worst: the first helicopter will rescue each group in a single flight.
	This means, travels[0] has n vectors of length 1, where n is the number of groups.

Operators:
	Group wise: 
		mov&del (g, %f1, f2): moves g from f1 to the last position of f2. It also deletes f1 if it is emptied. //f1 and f2 must be different!
		(*) swap (g1, %f1, g2, %f2): swaps g1 and g2, switching their positions from f1 and f2.
			* remove this operand when doing experiments, should not be that helpful probably
		Permute (f1, n): permutes the elements of a flight (*) this is not used when swap is!
	Flight wise:
		switchPilot (f, %h1, h2): delegates the flight f from H1 to H2.
		(*) swapOrder (f1, %f2): swaps the order of flights from ... f1, f2... to ... f2, f1...
			* This is only necessary for the second quality function!
